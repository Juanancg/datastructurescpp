# Data Structures in C++

A data structure is a way of organizing data so that it can be used effectively. They are essential ingredients in creating fast and powerful algorithms. They help to manage and organize data.
It also help to make code cleaner and easier to understand.


We should differenciate data structures(DS) from abstract data types (ADT). ADT represents what and DS how. For example:
| Abstraction (ADT) | Implementation (DS) |
| ------ | ------ |
| List | Dynamic Array<br>Linked List  |
| Queue | Array based Queue<br>Linked List based Queue |
| Map | Tree Map<br>Hash Table |
| Vehicle | Car<br>Airplane<br>Bicycle |
